#How to proceed to submit a talk#

##Just fork it##

 1. Fork this repository.
 2. Create a directory and name it something such as "my-awesome-talk" (no spaces).
 3. In that directory, add a proposal.yaml, you can find a [template here](https://github.com/react-europe/cfp-2015/blob/master/talk-sample/proposal.yaml). If there is another speaker, add a Speaker2 key using the same format.
 4. Add a picture of yourself to the dir called speaker1.jpg of size 500x500 (this will be used on the site), if there is another speaker, the file should be named speaker2.jpg and be incremented for each additional speakers.
 5. Commit and create a pull-request to this repo, selected talks will be merge into master.
 6. If you want to submit more than one talk, create a new branch and do a pull request for each branch.
 7. Want to have more chances to get your talk accepted? Add a link to a youtube video in the past_experience field where you would advertise your talk to attendees so we can re-use the video as promotional material on the conference website (idea from EmberConf :).
